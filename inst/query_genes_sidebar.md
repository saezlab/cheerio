#### Gene Query

<br>Select genes of interest below to explore their role in caridac hypertrophy.</br>
Following data sets can be queried:

- **Murine physiologic and pathologic hypertrophy**, in vivo, bulk RNAseq + bulk RIBOseq
- **Human heart failure** bulk RNAseq, we use ReHeaT, an assembly of 16 heart failure studies
- **Human heart failure** single cell RNAseq, we display cell type specific dysregulation reported by Chaffin et. al
- **human fetal hearts** bulk RNAseq, two fetal studies compared fetal to healthy adult hearts
