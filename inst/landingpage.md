### Abstract
**CHEERIO** (Cardiac HypErtrophy gEne expRessIOn) is an integrated resource designed to facilitate the study of gene expression in cardiac hypertrophy. It provides a comprehensive collection of data from rodent and human models, enabling researchers to explore the molecular underpinnings of cardiac hypertrophy and its progression to heart failure. The platform supports hypothesis generation and testing, offering an accessible and user-friendly interface for data analysis.

By combining diverse datasets, **CHEERIO** offers insights into the transcriptional and translational regulation of gene expression in both physiological and pathological hypertrophy. It highlights key differences between early and advanced stages of hypertrophy, and offers a detailed comparison across species. Additionally, **CHEERIO**enables the identification of gene expression changes specifically associated with cardiac failure in the context of pathological hypertrophy.
