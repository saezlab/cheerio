#### Generate Custom Signature

<br>Select contrasts of interest from the drop-down menues below to generate a signature of consistently up- or downregulated genes.</br>


Datasets are functionally grouped in **A. Animal models, B. Human Cardiac Hypertrophy, C+D. Human Heart Failure and Fetal Gene Program**.

We provide an overview of the number of genes that reached significance across contrasts.
Top consistently up- or downregulated genes are plotted and can be copied for further analysis.
You can select

- **1. Contrast IDs**: Contrasts represent differential gene expression analysis results from different experiments/studies. Select the contrasts of interest to explore consistently regulated genes. Please refer to our data overview (welcome page) for details on the contrasts.
- **2. Cut-off Alpha**: Set the desired significance level applied to each contrast.
- **3. Number of Genes Plotted**: Specify the number of top genes from the signature to be plotted.
- **4. Minimum Number of Contrasts**: Reduce this number to allow for missing values (NAs) and increase coverage of the gene signature.

Note: The group **B. Human Cardiac Hypertrophy** contains comparisons between HCM and DCM (HCMvsDCM) at bulk and single cell level. Select these datasets to search specifically for genes that are exclusively regulated in human HCM but not in DCM, suggesting that these genes are not regulated by human heart failure (very few genes).
