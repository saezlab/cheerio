### Abstract
**CHEERIO** (Cardiac HypErtrophy gEne expRessIOn) is an integrated resource designed to facilitate the study of gene expression in cardiac hypertrophy. It provides a comprehensive collection of data from rodent and human models, enabling researchers to explore gene regulation during cardiac hypertrophy and heart failure. The platform supports hypothesis generation and testing, offering an accessible and user-friendly interface for data analysis.

By combining diverse datasets, **CHEERIO** provides insights into the regulation of the transcriptome, translatome and proteome in both physiological and pathological hypertrophy. It highlights key differences between early and advanced stages of cardiac hypertrophy, and offers a detailed comparison across species. Additionally, **CHEERIO** enables the identification of gene expression changes specifically associated with cardiac failure in the context of pathological hypertrophy.
