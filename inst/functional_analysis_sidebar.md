#### Query estimated transcription factor activities

We estimated transcription factor (TF) activities with gene regulatory networks from [CollecTRI](https://github.com/saezlab/CollecTRI) using 
[decoupleR](https://github.com/saezlab/decoupleR). 

<br>Select transcription factors of interest to explore their estimated activity across datasets</br>

Please note that a not-significantly estimated TF does not necessarily mean that the TF of interest is not involved in gene regulation in the specific datasets. TF activity estimation is derived from TF regulons that are based on non-cardiac datasets and thus make TF activity estimation from cardiac gene expression data difficult.
