### Abstract

We herein introduce the CHEERIO (Cardiac HypErtrophy gEne expRessIOn) database, a comprehensive analysis and resource of cardiac gene expression during hypertrophic growth, supporting researchers in elaborating, testing, and refining their hypotheses on the molecular nature of cardiac hypertrophy assisted through a free and easy-to-use web application. By integrating a comprehensive set of rodent and human samples, CHEERIO reveals the transcriptional and translational regulation of gene expression during cardiac hypertrophy, the differences between early and established physiological and pathological hypertrophy, interspecies differences, and gene expression changes potentially caused primarily by cardiac failure during pathological hypertrophy.
