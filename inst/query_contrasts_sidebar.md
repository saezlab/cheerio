#### Generate Custom Signature

<br>Select contrasts of interest below to generate a signature of consistently up- or downregulated genes.</br>

Select contrasts from the drop-down menues below. Datasets are functionally grouped in A. Animal models, B. Human Cardiac Hypertrophy, C+D. Human Heart Failure und Fetal Gene Program
Note: The group B. Human Cardiac Hypertrophy contains comparisons between HCM and DCM (HCMvsDCM) at bulk and single cell level. Select those datasets to specifically search for genes that are exclusively regulated in human HCM but not DCM, an indication that those genes are not regulated by human heart failure (only very few genes).

We provide an overview of the number of genes that reached significance across contrasts.
Top consistently up- or downregulated genes are plotted and can be copied for further analysis.
You can select

- **1. Contrast IDs**: Contrasts represent differential gene expression analysis results from different experiments/studies. Select the contrasts of interest to explore consistently regulated genes. Please refer to our data overview (Welcome page) for details on the contrasts.
- **2. Cut-off Alpha**: Set the desired significance level for each individual contrast.
- **3. Number of Genes Plotted**: Specify the number of top genes from the signature to be plotted (individual plot for up- and downregulated genes).
- **4. Minimum Number of Contrasts**: Reduce this number to allow for missing values (NAs) and increase coverage of the gene signature.
