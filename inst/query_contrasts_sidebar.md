#### Custom Signature Generator

<br>Select contrasts of interest below to generate a signature of consistently dysregulated genes.</br>

We provide an overview of the number of genes that reached significance across contrasts.
Top consistently dysregulated genes are plotted and can be copied for further analysis.
You can select

- **1. Contrast IDs**: Contrasts represent differential gene expression analysis results from different experiments/studies. Select the contrasts of interest to explore consistently dysregulated genes. Please refer to our data overview for details on the contrasts.
Select those contrasts of interest, to explore consistently dysregulated genes. Please see our data overview for details on the contrasts.
- **2. Cut-off Alpha**: Set the desired significance level for each individual contrast.
- **3. Cut-off Top Genes**: Specify the number of top genes from the signature to be plotted.
- **4. Minimum Number of Contrasts**: Reduce this number to allow for missing values (NAs) and increase coverage of the gene signature.
