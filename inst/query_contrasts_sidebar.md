#### Contrast Query

<br>Select contrasts of interest below to explore consistent genes.</br>

We provide an overview of the number of genes that were reach significance across contrasts, 
and provide all genes from all contrasts in a table to be explored. We also plot the top genes

You can select

- **Contrast**, contrasts represent differential gene expression analysis results from different experiments/ studies.
Select those studies of interest, to explore consitently regulated genes. Please see our data overview for details on the contrasts.
- **Cut off alpha** desired significance level for each individual contrast.
- **Cut off genes plot** Select how many genes you want to plot.
