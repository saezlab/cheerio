#### Gene Query

<br>Select genes of interest by typing the gene name(s) in the search bar below to explore their regulation in cardiac hypertrophy.</br>

For a better overview, the data is divided into different functionally related groups.
Select one of the following categories by clicking on the headings at the top:


- **A. Animal Models**
In vivo mouse pathologic and physiologic cardiac hypertrophy (bulk transcriptomics, cardiomyocyte-specific translatomics and proteomics);
in vitro PE-induced cardiomycote hypertrophy model (bulk transcriptomics, translatomics, proteomics)

- **B. Human Cardiac Hypertrophy**
Human cardiac hypertrophy transcriptomics on bulk and single cell level and proteomics

- **C. Human heart failure**
Bulk RNAseq from DCM and ICM patients. We use ReHeaT, an assembly of 16 heart failure studies.

- **D. Fetal Gene Program**
Bulk RNAseq, comparing fetal to adult healthy hearts
